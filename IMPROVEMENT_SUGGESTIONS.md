## üî¥ CURRENT STATIC DATA THAT SHOULD BE DYNAMIC (Backend API)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Product Data (`src/lib/products-data.ts`)**

```typescript
// CURRENTLY STATIC - SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
export const products = [
  // 32 hardcoded product objects with:
  // - id, name, price, imageUrl, category, categoryId
  // - description, shortDescription, detailedDescription
  // - unit, weight, discount, inStock
];

// Helper functions that should use API calls
export function getProductsByCategory(categoryId: string) { ... }
export function getCategoriesWithCounts() { ... }
```

**Why Dynamic is Better:**

- **Real-time inventory** - Stock levels, prices, availability
- **Personalization** - User-specific recommendations
- **Admin management** - Easy product updates, additions, removals
- **Analytics** - Track popular products, trends
- **Scalability** - Handle thousands of products efficiently

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Category Data (`src/lib/data/categories.tsx`)**

```typescript
// CURRENTLY STATIC - SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
export const categories = [
  { id: "fruits", name: "Fruits", icon: Apple, ... },
  { id: "vegetables", name: "Vegetables", icon: Carrot, ... },
  // ... hardcoded categories
];
```

**Why Dynamic is Better:**

- **Flexible categorization** - Add/remove categories easily
- **Multi-level categories** - Subcategories, tags
- **Localization** - Multiple languages
- **SEO optimization** - Dynamic meta descriptions

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Product Counts and Filtering**

```typescript
// CURRENTLY STATIC - SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
const storeProducts = products.slice(0, 30); // First 30 products
const featuredProducts = products.slice(30, 40); // Next 10 products
```

**Why Dynamic is Better:**

- **Smart recommendations** - AI-powered product selection
- **User behavior** - Show products based on browsing history
- **Seasonal content** - Dynamic featured products
- **Performance optimization** - Lazy loading, pagination

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **User Data & Preferences**

```typescript
// CURRENTLY STATIC - SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
- User authentication & profiles
- Shopping history
- Wishlist items
- Personal preferences
- Address book
- Payment methods
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Logic & Rules**

```typescript
// CURRENTLY STATIC - SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
- Pricing rules (bulk discounts, seasonal sales)
- Shipping rates & zones
- Tax calculations
- Coupon codes & promotions
- Inventory thresholds
- Business hours & delivery slots
```
